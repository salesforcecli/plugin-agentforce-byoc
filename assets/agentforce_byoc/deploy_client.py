"""HTTP client for the Agentforce BYOC deploy/upload API.

Implements the two-step package upload against the Agentforce BYOC platform:

1. ``POST <base>/byoc/upload/request`` to register package metadata AND obtain a
   presigned upload URL in one call. The body carries ``packageName``,
   ``version``, ``packageSize``, ``entryPoints``, and ``maxLiveDurationS``; the
   response returns the presigned ``uploadUrl``.
2. ``PUT`` the package archive to that presigned URL.

Deployment status can then be polled read-only via
``GET <base>/byoc/upload/status?packageName=&version=``, which reports
``registrationStatus`` (is the package registered) and ``uploadStatus`` (has the
archive been uploaded). That endpoint never writes — registration happens in
step 1.

The base URL is resolved by
:func:`agentforce_byoc.gateway.relay_client.resolve_sfap_base_url` — from the
``BYOC_PROXY_URL`` environment variable when set, else derived from the tenant
id. Auth is sent as ``Authorization: Bearer <org-jwt>`` plus the
``x-sfdc-core-tenant-id``, ``x-sfdc-user-id``, and ``x-sfdc-app-context``
headers.

Uses only the Python standard library so nothing extra is bundled into a BYOC
package.
